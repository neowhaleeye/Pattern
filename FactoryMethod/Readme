Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. 

Product : defines the interface of objects the factory method creates
Concreate Product : implements the Product interface

Creator : declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product, Creator may also define a default implementation of the factory method that returns a default ConcreateProject object
may call the factory method to create a product object

Concrete Creator : overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreateProduct
